# Risk
This project is a tool to calculate probabilities of invasions in the board
game _Risk_. Not only can the tool output the exact probability of success for
a given attack, it can also calculate the probability of winning with a certain
number of troops left and/or wearing the enemy territory's forces down to a
specified number of units. It also has an interactive mode for evaluating the
likelihood of an attack's success *as it is underway*.

##Installation
You will need Python 3 to use this tool. For now, there's no easy installation
method other than downloading the scripts and dropping them in 
```/usr/local/bin```.
